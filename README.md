# Welcome to my Personal Site!

My personal site [alexfeller.dev](https://alexfeller.dev) is about all things me. It's dedicated to my previous and current work experience, as well as design and development projects.

## Motivation?

I wanted to create a fun and simplistic, yet effective website where anyone could get information about how to contact me, my work experience, and provide a home base to find all the different types of work I have done.

## Quick Start

To get the project up and running locally:

`git clone https://github.com/AlexF26/My-Personal-Site.git`

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
